<h2 id = "simba">Simba</h2>
    <p>Simba is the protagonist of Disney's 1994 animated feature film, The Lion King. He is the son of Mufasa, who was destined to rule the Pride Lands, as king. When Mufasa is killed in a wildebeest stampede, Simba is blamed for the tragedy and abandons his kingdom in guilt. He finds refuge in a jungle oasis with a meerkat and warthog, but the Pride Lands fall to disarray during his absence. With the kingdom in peril, Simba is forced to confront his troubled past to take his place in the "Circle of Life".</p>

<h2 id = "nala">Nala</h2>
  <p>Nala is the deuteragonist of Disney's 1994 animated feature film The Lion King. She is the lifelong best friend of Simba, prince of the Pride Lands. When the kingdom is taken over by Scar and his hyena henchmen, Nala rebels against their reign by assisting Simba in reclaiming the throne. She would later become Simba's queen and the mother of two cubs: Kiara and Kion.</p>
<h2 id = "rafiki">Rafiki</h2>
  <p>Rafiki is a supporting character of Disney's 1994 animated feature film The Lion King. He is a mandrill who serves as Royal Mjuzi of the Pride Lands. Rafiki has an eccentricity that paints him as something of a lunatic; in truth, he is a sage with a deep connection to magical and spiritual elements. With his bakora stick always on his person, Rafiki uses his wisdom to guide those in need, most notably Simba.</p>
<h2 id ="scar">Scar</h2>
  <p>Scar (born Askari) is the main antagonist of Disney's 1994 animated feature film, The Lion King. As the younger brother of Mufasa and second-born prince of the Pride Lands, Scar was next in line to assume the throne as king. His chances were lost, however, at the birth of his nephew Simba. This embittered Scar with jealousy and a sense of entitlement, prompting him to develop a regicidal plot to take over the kingdom, with the aid of his hyena henchmen.</p>
